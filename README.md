# Arduino-RLCMeter
C code developed for Arduino to switch measurement modes (Resistance, Capacitance, and Inductance) based on the signal received from mobile app \
If "R" is received, it would change to Resistance Mode, and starts to measure. The measured values are send back to the Mobile App via USB Serial Communication, and displayed on the App.\
Same principles may apply for other measurement mode which are "C" for Capactance  "L" for Inductance. \
The Java code for the Mobile App is uploaded in a new repo : https://github.com/mikepang98/AndroidApp-Arduino
